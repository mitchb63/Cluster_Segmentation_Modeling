# Cluster_Segmentation_Modeling

Creation of a synthesized, value-added cluster segmentation asset comparable to Esri's Tapestry or Claritas' Prizm.  This project was conducted as part of Wittenberg University's ANLT 530 course, Data Mining.

**(Work in Progress)**

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to obtain a “big data” dataset compiled around United States Census Bureau data. The dataset was to be compiled at the Zip or Zip+4 level, and use 10 year census data as the foundation with additional 5 and/or 1 year census data added if it appeared to be useful. Additional data from outside sources could also be added to the base data if it proved useful.  A segmentation model was then created using k-means clustering.  

## Application
The final resulting clusters will be named and their characteristics evaluated based on the marketing objectives of the bicycle industry (retail sellers of bicycles and components, bicycle-centric organizations such as USA Cycling, etc.)  The objective here will be to identify specific areas where marketing efforts are likely to achieve the greatest results.  These areas may vary depending on the specific product or service being offered.  The final deliverable may be an interface that shows the segmentation groups across a specific local area and/o the ability to select a product or service type and then display the areas best suited for that item.
